# The-Expression-Tree-Evaluato
The Expression Tree Evaluator is a C-based program that reads mathematical expressions from a file, converts infix notation to postfix notation, constructs an expression tree, evaluates the result, and saves the output to a file. This program is useful for handling and computing algebraic expressions efficiently.

# # Features
